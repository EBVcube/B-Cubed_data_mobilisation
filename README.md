# B-Cubed_data_mobilisation
This repository documents the development of the first B-Cubed data mobilisation. Data will be mobilised from GBIF to the EBV Portals using both the B-Cubed software developed by GBIF and the ebvcube package.

We start by mobilising the occurrence of species listed in:
1. The list of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) of EU concern (88 species).
2. Annex I of the Birds Directive (~200 species)

Later we will mobilise:
3. The Global Reptile Assessment (~10000 species) 

The specifications for the generation of the occurence cubes can be found in separate files in this repository. 

The code is available in Rmarkdown and renderd as HTML and PDF notebooks. The noteboooks structure are in Table 1 for the Invasive Alien Species (IAS) of EU concern and Table 2 for the Annex I of the Birds Directive.
