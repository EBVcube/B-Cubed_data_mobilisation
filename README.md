# B-Cubed_data_mobilization
This repository documents the development of the first B-Cubed data mobilisation. Data will be mobilised from GBIF to the EBV Portals using both the B-Cubed software developed by GBIF and the ebvcube package.

We start by mobilising the occurrence of species listed in:
1. The list of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) of EU concern (88 species).
2. Annex I of the Birds Directive (~200 species)
3. The Global Reptile Assessment (~10000 species)

The specifications for the generation of the buckets can be found in separate files in this repository.
