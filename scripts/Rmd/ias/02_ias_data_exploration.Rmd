### Introduction
In this notebook we explore the occurrence data of invasive alien species (IAS) of union concern available in GBIF until June 2024.
To do this, an IAS occurrence cube was previously created using the [occurrence cube software](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-use/data-cubes) developed by GBIF under the [Biodiversity Building Blocks for Policy](https://b-cubed.eu/) (B3) project
Details of the data query in GBIF are available at: [doi: 10.15468/dl.x4a25s](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download/0081452-240506114902167). 
The cube generation script is also part of this repository.

*Note: This series of notebooks is part of the results of Task 3.3 of the [Biodiversity Building Blocks for Policy](https://b-cubed.eu/) Project funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme (ID No 101059592). Additional notebooks exploring the results and calculating simple metrics are also available in the same repository.*



### Load library and input data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
gc()

# load requiered libraries
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(b3gbi)
library(stringr)
```

After loading the necessary libraries, we load the occurrence cube of IAS obtained previously through the GBIF API.

```{r}
# Load IAS occurrence cube obtained through GBIF
# cin <- read.csv(here(paste0("output/datacubes/csv/ias/","0077925-240506114902167.csv")),  sep = "\t")

# File name from the JSON query
occcube <- "0077925-240506114902167"

# Load occurrence cube using b3gbi
cin <- process_cube(here(paste0("output/datacubes/csv/ias/", occcube,".csv")))

# Load species taxonomy only with scientific names ‘accepted’ in the GBIF backbone taxonomy
tax <- read.csv(here("input/data/ias/taxonomy/List87IAS_EU_match_gbif_allaccepted.csv"))
```


### Data Analysis
#### Calculate Total Number of Occurrence

```{r}
cdata <- cin[["data"]]
# rename columns
colnames(cdata)[colnames(cdata) == "order"] <- "order_"
colnames(cdata)[colnames(cdata) == "taxonKey"] <- "acceptedUsageKey"

# Aggregate occurrences at species level
cag <- cdata %>%
  group_by(acceptedUsageKey) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs))

 # Sort in ascending order
cag <- cag[order(cag$totalOcc), ] 
```

```{r}
# Rename columns for joining datasets
# colnames(tax)[colnames(tax) == "key"] <- "acceptedUsageKey"
tax[,c("acceptedUsageKey")] <- tax[,c("key")]

# Rename columns for joining occurence cube with GBIF Backbone taxonomy
xout <- merge(x=cag, y=tax[,c("scientificName", "acceptedUsageKey", "kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family")], by="acceptedUsageKey")
xout <- xout[order(xout$totalOcc), ]

write.csv(xout, here("output/summary_data/csv/summary_ias_totalOccurrences.csv"))
```

#### Identify IAS without Records in GBIF
```{r}
# Find what species have no records in GBIF
noocc <- anti_join(tax, cag, by = "acceptedUsageKey")
write.csv(noocc, here("output/summary_data/csv/ias_noOccurrences.csv"))
print(noocc)
```


### Data Exploration

We will explore data available since 1900. To do this, first we split the 'yearMonth' column into 'year' and 'month'.


```{r}
# Convert date from character to numeric
todates <- as.data.frame(str_split(cdata$yearMonth, "-", simplify = TRUE))
colnames(todates) <- c("year", "month")

# Add year and month columns separate to the initial data
cdata$year <- todates$year
cdata$month <- todates$month

# Filter data starting from 1900
cdata2 <- cdata %>%
  filter(year > 1900)

# Group data by year
cag_year <- cdata2 %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs))

# Group data by month
cag_month <- cdata %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs))
```

In the following code chunk we plot the GBIF occurrences available since 1900 for the IAS of union concern.
```{r}
ggplot(cag_year, aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = totalOcc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  # guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::label_comma(accuracy = 1)) +
  # coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Species Occurrences in GBIF for IAS of union concern since 1900",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total number of occurence") +
       guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Now we plot the all GBIF occurrences per month for the IAS of union concern.
```{r}
ggplot(cag_month, aes(x = as.numeric(month), y = totalOcc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  # guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,4,7,10), labels = c("Jan", "Apr", "Jul", "Oct")) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::label_comma(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Species Occurrences in GBIF for the IAS of union concern",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total number of occurence") +
       guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Our last plot shows the increasing number of records since 2000 for the five species with the highest records.
```{r}
# Aggregate occurrences at species level
cag_sp <- cdata %>%
  group_by(acceptedUsageKey) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs))

# Select the five species with more records 
cag_sel <- cag_sp[(dim(cag_sp)[1]-5):dim(cag_sp)[1],]

# Subset data set
cag_top5 <- cdata %>% 
  inner_join(cag_sel[,c("acceptedUsageKey")], by = "acceptedUsageKey") %>%
  filter(year > 1990)

# Aggregate occurrences by year
cag_top5year <- cag_top5 %>%
  group_by(year, scientificName) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs), scientificName = first(scientificName))

```

Plot the five species with more records in GBIF since 2000
```{r}
ggplot(cag_top5year, aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = totalOcc, color = scientificName, name = "Species")) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.6) +
  guides(color=guide_legend(ncol=1, title = "Species")) +
  labs(title = "Yearly Species Occurrences Since 1990 for the Five Most Recorded Species in GBIF from the Birds Directive Annex I",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Total number of occurence") +
  theme_minimal()
```
