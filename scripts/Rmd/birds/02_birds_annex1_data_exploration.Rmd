### Introduction
In this notebook we explore the occurrence data of species listed in the Annex I of the Birds Directive available in GBIF until June 2024.
To do this, a Birds occurrence cube was previously created using the [occurrence cube software](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-use/data-cubes) developed by GBIF under the [Biodiversity Building Blocks for policy project](https://b-cubed.eu/) (B3).
Details of the data query in GBIF are available at: [doi: 10.15468/dl.43ydtq](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.43ydtq). 
The cube generation script is also part of this repository.

*Note: This series of notebooks is part of the results of Task 3.3 of the [Biodiversity Building Blocks for Policy](https://b-cubed.eu/) Project funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme (ID No 101059592). Additional notebooks exploring the results and calculating simple metrics are also available in the same repository.*


### Load library and input data
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
gc()

# load requiered libraries
library(here)
library(b3gbi) # for csv occurrence cubes
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
```

After loading the necessary libraries, we load the occurrence cube of birds obtained previously through the GBIF API.

```{r}
# File name from the JSON query
occcube <- "0044085-240626123714530"

# Load occurrence cube using b3gbi
cin <- process_cube(here(paste0("output/datacubes/csv/birds/", occcube,".csv")))

# Load species taxonomy only with ‘accepted’ scientific names in the GBIF backbone taxonomy
tax <- read.csv(here("input/data/birds/taxonomy/list193birds_directive_annexi_allaccepted_usagekey_gbif.csv"))
```


### Data Analysis
#### Calculate Total Number of Occurrence

First we calculate the total number of occurence by family.
```{r}
cdata <- cin[["data"]]
# rename columns
colnames(cdata)[colnames(cdata) == "order"] <- "order_" # Note that if the name only remains as "order" this can be confused with the R funtcion 'order' to sort data.
colnames(cdata)[colnames(cdata) == "taxonKey"] <- "acceptedUsageKey"

# Aggregate occurrences at the family level
cag <- cdata %>%
  group_by(family) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs), Order = first(order_))

# Sort in ascending order
cag <- cag[order(cag$totalOcc), ]

# Save file
write.csv(cag, here("output/summary_data/csv/summary_birds_total_occurrences_byfamily+order.csv"))
```

Now, we calculate the total number of occurence by species.
```{r}
# Aggregate occurrences at species level
cag_sp <- cdata %>%
  group_by(acceptedUsageKey) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs))

# Sort in ascending order
cag_sp <- cag_sp[order(cag_sp$totalOcc), ]

# Check family with one record
position <- which(cdata$family == "Columbidae")
second_row <- cdata %>%
  slice(position)
as.data.frame(second_row) # taxon key 2495406
```

```{r}
# Rename columns for joining occurence cube with GBIF Backbone taxonomy. Remember our species identifier is the 'acceptedUsageKey'

# Merge data sets and sort in ascending order
xout <- cag_sp %>% 
  inner_join(tax[,c("scientificName", "key", "kingdom", "phylum", "class", "order", "family", "acceptedUsageKey")], by = "acceptedUsageKey")

xout <- xout[order(xout$totalOcc), ]

# Save file
write.csv(xout, here("output/summary_data/csv/summary_birds_total_occurrences_acceptedusagekey.csv"))
```

#### Identify birds without species occurrences through the GBIF occurrence cube software

```{r}
# Find what species have no records in GBIF
noocc <- anti_join(tax, cag_sp, by = "acceptedUsageKey")
write.csv(noocc, here("output/summary_data/csv/birds_no_occurrences_acceptedusagekeys.csv"))
print(noocc[,c("scientificName", "acceptedUsageKey")])
```

As a remark, the list above refers to Subspecies that cannot be identified by the 'speciesKey' of our JSON query.

### Data Exploration

We will start checking the number of records since 1950.

```{r}
# Convert date from character to numeric
todates <- as.data.frame(str_split(cdata$yearMonth, "-", simplify = TRUE))
colnames(todates) <- c("year", "month")

# Add year and month columns separate to the initial data
cdata$year <- todates$year
cdata$month <- todates$month

# Filter data starting from 1950
cdata2 <- cdata %>%
  filter(year > 1950)

# Group data by year
cag_year <- cdata2 %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs))

# Group data by month
cag_month <- cdata %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs))

```

In the following code chunk we plot the GBIF occurrences available since 1950 for the Bird Directive species in Annex I.
```{r}
ggplot(cag_year, aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = totalOcc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  # guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::label_comma(accuracy = 1)) +
  # coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Species Occurrences in GBIF for the Birds Directive Annex I since 1950",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Total number of occurence") +
       guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +
  theme_minimal()
```


Now we plot the all GBIF occurrences per month for the Bird Directive species in Annex I.
```{r}
ggplot(cag_month, aes(x = as.numeric(month), y = totalOcc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  # guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=1)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1,4,7,10), labels = c("Jan", "Apr", "Jul", "Oct")) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::label_comma(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Species Occurrences in GBIF for the Birds Directive Annex I per month",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total number of occurence") +
       guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +
  theme_minimal()
```


The next plot shows the occurrence of birds by family and the bars are coloured by the taxonomic order.
```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height= 6.5}
# Create a horizontal bar plot
ggplot(cag, aes(x = reorder(family, -totalOcc), y = totalOcc, fill = Order)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(ncol=1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::label_comma(accuracy = 1)) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Total Number of Species Occurrences in GBIF for the Birds Directive Annex I",
       x = "Family",
       y = "Total number of occurence") +
       guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 5))) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Our last plot shows the increasing number of records since 2000 for the five species with the highest records.
```{r}
# Select the five species with more records 
cag_sel <- cag_sp[(dim(cag_sp)[1]-5):dim(cag_sp)[1],]

# Subset data set
cag_top5 <- cdata %>% 
  inner_join(cag_sel[,c("acceptedUsageKey")], by = "acceptedUsageKey") %>%
  filter(year > 1990)

# Aggregate occurrences by year
cag_top5year <- cag_top5 %>%
  group_by(year, scientificName) %>%
  summarize(totalOcc = sum(obs), scientificName = first(scientificName))

```

Lastly, this plot shows the five species with more records in GBIF since 2000.
```{r}
ggplot(cag_top5year, aes(x = as.numeric(year), y = totalOcc, color = scientificName, name = "Species")) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.3) +
  guides(color=guide_legend(ncol=1, title = "Species")) +
  labs(title = "Yearly Species Occurrences Since 1990 for the Five Most Recorded Species in GBIF from the Birds Directive Annex I",
       x = "Time",
       y = "Total number of occurence") +
  theme_minimal()
```
