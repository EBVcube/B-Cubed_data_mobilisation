### Introduction
In this notebook we create a cube of occurrence of birds listed in the Annex I of the Birds Directive based on all species records available in GBIF until June 2024.
To do this, we sent a request with the cube specifications (JSON file) via the GBIF API. We used the occurrence cube generation software developed in the [Biodiversity Building Blocks for policy project](https://b-cubed.eu/).
Details of the GBIF data query are available at: [change!!!!](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download/0081452-240506114902167). 

*Note: This series of notebooks is part of the results of the Task 3.3 of the [Biodiversity Building Blocks for policy project](https://b-cubed.eu/) funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon Europe Research and Innovation Programme (ID No 101059592). Additional notebooks exploring the results and calculating simple metrics are also available at the same repository.*

### Load libraries
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE)
```

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
gc()

# load requiered libraries
library(here)
library(httr)
library(httr2)
library(jsonlite)
library(b3gbi)
```

### Submitting a JSON query
The JSON file containing the query specification was prepared in advance (see the "input/queries" folder). In this case, the cube specification includes the geographical extent (EU27), the spatial resolution (~1 km), the time period (>1900), the species of interest (Invasive Alien Species of Union Concern (IAS), the top taxonomy and the data sources. We used the 1 km grid of the European Environment Agency as a reference.

```{r}
# save GBIF API address
gbif_url <- 'http://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/download/request/' 

# set GBIF user name and password. In this example the data is saved in a separate file for security reasons. Fill in the variables with your own data.
gbif_user <- read.csv("C:/gitrepo/credentials.txt", header = FALSE);
my_username <- gbif_user[1,1]; # 'your_username'
my_password <- gbif_user[2,1]; # 'your_password'

# set the location for the resulting occurrence cube
path_out <- here("output/datacubes/csv/birds")

# load the JSON with the query specifications
query_ias <- "query_birds_annex1.json"
```


```{r}
# Request data using GBIF API and your saved query
req <-  request(gbif_url) |> 
  req_auth_basic(username = my_username, password = my_password) |> 
  req_headers("Content-Type" = "application/json") |> 
  req_retry(max_tries = 5) |>
  req_body_file(here(paste0("input/queries/", query_ias)), type = NULL)

# Perform the request and return the response (the response is a download ID)
response <- req |> req_perform()  |> resp_body_string()
#"0022303-240626123714530" # test query
```

### Unpacking the IAS occurrence cube and loading it into R

```{r}
# download the cube
download.file(paste0(gbif_url, response, ".zip"), destfile=paste0(path_out, response, ".zip"))

# or download manually from
paste0(gbif_url, response)

# unzip
unzip(paste0(path_out, "/", response,".zip"), exdir=paste0(path_out,"/"))
```

The resulting occurrence cube is in a CSV data format. The number of species occurrence are aggregated per cell based on the (enconded) reference grid. There are a few ways to load the resulting occurrence cube. Here we show two appraoches. One is using the CSV read command and the other one is using the 'b3gbi' library.

```{r}
# load GBIF data cube using a simple CSV read function
c1 <- read.csv(paste0(path_out, "/", response,".csv"), sep = "\t")
colnames(c1)
```
Alrternatively we can use the  ```process_cube```  function from the 'b3gbi' library.

```{r}
# prepare cube using b3gbi
c2 <- process_cube(paste0(path_out, "/", response,".csv"))
print(c2)
```
