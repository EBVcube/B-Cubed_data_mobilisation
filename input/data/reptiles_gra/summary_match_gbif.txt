I run the species matching tool from GBIF and the results are very good. See below:
We have a perfect match for:                     9857 species
We can use the names exactly as they are in the GRA dataset to query GBIF.
We have a fuzzy match for:                         143 species 
For these 143 species we need to replace the GRA species name (verbatimScientificName_(GRA)) with the GBIF backbone name (species_(GBIF))for the queries to GBIF. Most of these are 97, 98, 99% match and with a missing “i” or “e” or a synonym.
We have no match for:                                  3 species
We leave these species out.
File with the results attached.
